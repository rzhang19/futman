### DO
- always use test driven development
- understand expected behavior based on criteria given during prompting
- create tests based on expected behavior, with "Given, When, Then" situations, and a test per GWT
- after creating the code, run the tests and ensure all tests pass before continuing
- if any tests fail, stop the generation so I can review

### DON'T
- do not add any heavy dependencies without approval

### Permissions
Allowed without prompting:
- read files
- list files

Ask first before acting:
- package installs
- git push
- deleting files, chmod
- running full build or end to end suites
